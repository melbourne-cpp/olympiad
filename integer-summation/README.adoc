== Integer Summation

=== Challenge

Calculate the sum of a series of non-negative integers specified on the command line and print the result to stdout.

=== Dataset

==== Input

The list of integers are supplied to `main` as commandline arguments (argc/argv).

The integers are never negative.

The integers may be of arbitrary length.

The integers may be of arbitrary quantity.

==== Output

The script `summation.py` tests an executable against a selection of pseudo-random inputs and their expected outputs (with a constant seed).

To test an executable you can execute:

[source,python]
----
summation.py a.out
----

WARNING: The script is `minimally' tested. YMMV.
